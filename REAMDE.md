<h1 align="center">🧑‍🍳 CHEF CHALLENGE - BACKEND</h1>

_<h5 align="center">"An app to prove and improve your cooking skills"</h5>_

Chef Challenge is an app that generates receipes (or challenges) when you do not know what to cook. It can generate random, yet balanced receipes, but can also find receipes with what you have in your fridge.

This repository is the backend part of the Chef Challenge project.
